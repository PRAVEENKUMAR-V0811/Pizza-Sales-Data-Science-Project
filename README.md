#### Technical Details
- **Libraries Used**: `pandas`, `Prophet`
- **Input File**: `pizza_sales.csv`
- **Output File**: `monthly_sales_forecast_2016.csv`
- **Script**: `monthly_sales_forecasting.py`
- **Integration**: Forecast results can be imported into Power BI for visualization and reporting

#### Functionality
